## Description

This is an arcade-style game where the player has to avoid bugs on their way to the water. Once the player has reached the water, the game ends.

## Instructions

Load the game by opening index.html in the browser of your choice. Then you can start playing!

To play the game, use the up, down, left and right keys to move across the tiles. The player must avoid the bugs to win, but if they collide with a bug then the game resets. Once the player has successfully reached the water, the game is over and the player has the option to play again.
